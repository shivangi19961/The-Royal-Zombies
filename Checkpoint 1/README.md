Checkpoint 1

For this checkpoint, our team performed exploratory data analysis using PostgreSQL. We analyzed the officers with sustained complaints, as well as the allegation categories for which complaints were sustained.

Our group analyzed the questions given below. We have listed the corresponding SQL script which can be found in src/ as well as a brief analysis of the result.

 
1. What percent of total complaints are sustained depending on the allegation category? 
   
   Script1.sql

2. What is the difference in percentage of sustained complaints from civilians and officers?

   Script2.sql

3. a) What categories of complaints are most/least likely to have severe (more than reprimand) consequences? 
   b) What are the complaint categories with no severe consequences? 

   Script3.sql

4. Are the officers with sustained complaints against them part of a crew? 

   Script4.sql
   
5. What proportion of officers with 1 or more allegations and 0,1+,2+ sustained allegations against them get promoted each year? 

   Script5.sql
   
6. What proportion of officers with 1 or more allegations and 0,1+,2+ sustained allegations against them get awarded each year?
