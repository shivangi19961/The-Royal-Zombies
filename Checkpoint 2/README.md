Checkpoint 1

For this checkpoint, our team performed exploratory data analysis with SQL. We analyzed officer data and data of officer allegations and found out answers about the relation between the recommended and final outcomes and also found out answers about the background information of the officers who were reprimanded.

Our group analyzed the following 5 questions. We have listed the corresponding SQL script which can be found in src/ as well as a brief analysis of the result.

 
1. What percent of disciplinary actions are sustained over a period of time?
   
  Story 1 

2. What is the difference between sustained and unsustained complaints from civilian and police officers?

   Story 2

3. What is the background (race) and (rank) of police officers for which complaints were sustained against?
