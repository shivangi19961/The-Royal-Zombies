This Checkpoint deals with creating visualizations using Tableau for the following three questions:

1. What is the number of sustained complaints per allegation category decade over decade? 

2. What are the allegation categories with the highest number of severe consequences for police officers? 

3. What is the distribution of race and rank of the police officers with sustained complaints against them? 

To see the visualizations, click on the CP2.twbx and go to 'Sustained complaint count by category', 'Severe consequences count by category' and 'Rank/race of officers with sustained complaints'.
